# Password Generator
## About This Project
---
**Design to be viewed at Iphone X resolution (375px x 812px), although it works at higher resolutions. Just not as pretty.**

This project was a way to practice Javascript and creating a functional, interactive password generator. Buttons are used to determine the types of characters included, and a slider to select the length. Additionally, a button to generate a new password and another to automatically copy the password to your clipboard. The app utilizes bootstrap 4 and CSS grid for a responsive layout.
